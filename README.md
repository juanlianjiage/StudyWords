The project is a memorization of words based on the Ebbinghaus memory curve, which is currently in closed beta and is only available for internal use. 
The memory curve is realized by designing the KEY through the Redis cache database, the students learn the words by querying the cache database.
And the students review the words by using the Ebbinghaus memory curve to design the keys and expiration time in the cache database for the words that need to be reviewed.
Use Apache POI and Easyexcel third-party classes with components such as Element-UI Upload to implement student information and student learning records updated the import and export of thesaurus.
The technologies involved in the project include Spring-Boot, MySql, Redis, MyBatis, JS, JQuery, Vue-Element, etc.
